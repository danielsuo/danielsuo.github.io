## Notes

For when I didn't totally understand something. These are all works in progress and have no guarantees for correctness or sanity. To my enemies: see my weaknesses here.

- [Systems](systems): I spend most of my time in distributed systems now. I have a long and unorganized history of notes, so finally trying to consolidate here.
- [Linear Algebra](linear-algebra): in collaboration with [Zhigang Suo](http://www.seas.harvard.edu/suo/). This is a work in progress that will eventually be brought into $$\LaTeX$$. Original notes [here](http://imechanica.org/node/19709
- [Computer Vision](vision): I spent about a year tinkering in vision and robotics. [Lots](Lots of fun) (and [lots of photos](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipM-gw84bVVaIP-uQoGXTUlZM2MPBrJqzOhyYj5fdWOHy8zU_SxZKoJkm60k_c3hOA?key=aGExRU5UVmZLRkFKMUNOUkxDcW1MektvUlZ1a2t3)), but the time to move on eventually came.
- [AI/ML](aiml): I [dabble](https://github.com/plaidlab) with some friends.
- [Reading](reading): as yet unclassified notes on papers, books, articles
