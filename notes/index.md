## Notes

These are all works in progress and have no guarantees for correctness or sanity.

- [Linear Algebra](linear-algebra): in collaboration with [Zhigang Suo](http://www.seas.harvard.edu/suo/). This is a work in progress that will eventually be brought into $$\LaTeX$$. Original notes [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/cxeogfwrlr14ate/AAB_7FiNKKqnHgFEkUDLqQTPa?dl=0).
- [Computer Vision](vision): for when I didn't totally understand something. To my enemies: see my weaknesses here.
