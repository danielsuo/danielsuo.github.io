## Notes

For when I didn't totally understand something. These are all works in progress and have no guarantees for correctness or sanity. To my enemies: see my weaknesses here.

- [Linear Algebra](linear-algebra): in collaboration with [Zhigang Suo](http://www.seas.harvard.edu/suo/). This is a work in progress that will eventually be brought into $$\LaTeX$$. Original notes [here](http://imechanica.org/node/19709).
- [Computer Vision](vision)
- [Systems](systems)
- [AI/ML](aiml)
- [Reading](reading): as yet unclassified notes on papers, books, articles
