#### Irradiance
Irradiance is the radiant flux received by a surface per unity area. Radiant flux, or radiant power, is the radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted, or received, per unit time. Radiant flux is measured in watts, which are defined as joules per second, and describes the rate of energy transfer with respect to time. 1 joule is equal to the energy transferred, or work done, when applying a force of one newton (accelerate a one kilogram mass at 1 meter per second squared) through a distance of one meter. To sum up, irradiance is the energy transferred per second (watts) through an area (meters squared): $W/m^2$
