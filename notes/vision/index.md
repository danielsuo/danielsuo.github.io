### Images

#### Pixels
From [class notes](http://vision.princeton.edu/courses/COS429/2014fa/slides/02_camera/): Conceptually, each pixel is a sample of the radiance arriving at a camera viewpoint from a direction. The camera records the number of photons captured for each pixel in its sensor in a given period of time and approximates the power (energy from the photons in a given time) for all pixels.

#### Photograph
From [class notes](http://vision.princeton.edu/courses/COS429/2014fa/slides/02_camera/): A photograph is a slice of the plenoptic function 

- At a particular point of view $(x,y,z)$
- In the camera's field of view (range over $\theta$ and $\phi$)
- At a certain time $t$
- Over a range of frequencies $\lambda$
