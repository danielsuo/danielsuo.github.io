## Main idea
- **What is the problem?** Facebook processes enormous numbers of videos each day and must make those available as quickly as possible with as much flexibility for processing (e.g., computer vision algorithms) as possible
- **Why is it important?** Videos are increasingly defining the online experience, but can be quite complex to process at scale
- **What is the approach?** See Figure 2. Exploit inherent parallelism in video data to process and store chunks of video while uploading (pipelining)
- **What is the result?** All of Facebook video data is processed by this system and developers can create new processing stages or paths for video easily

## Notes
- The challenge appears to be scale and robustness, not necessarily algorithm or design. There are _many_ corner cases to consider.

## Questions

## Extension ideas
- How can we modify this infrastructure to support real-time (i.e., live video or even deadlines)?
