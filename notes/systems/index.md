# Notes on Systems

Despite multiple efforts, I prefer reading and scribbling on paper copies of papers. Indubitably worse, I read papers pretty sloppily during the research process because I generally feel a rush to find answers. So here's an attempt to read in a more..."scholarly" way...and take some notes electronically.
