<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hold you up to say to your mother, &#8216;this kid&#8217;s gonna be the best kid in the world. This kid&#8217;s gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew.&#8217; And you grew up good and wonderful. It was great just watching you, every day was like a privilege. Then the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world, and you did. But somewhere along the line, you changed. You stopped being you. You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you&#8217;re no good. And when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame, like a big shadow. Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain&#8217;t all sunshine and rainbows. It&#8217;s a very mean and nasty place and I don&#8217;t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain&#8217;t about how hard ya hit. It&#8217;s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That&#8217;s how winning is done! Now if you know what you&#8217;re worth then go out and get what you&#8217;re worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain&#8217;t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain&#8217;t you! You&#8217;re better than that! I&#8217;m always gonna love you no matter what. No matter what happens. You&#8217;re my son and you&#8217;re my blood. You&#8217;re the best thing in my life. But until you start believing in yourself, ya ain&#8217;t gonna have a life. Don&#8217;t forget to visit your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I remember reading an article when I was about twelve years old. I think it might have been Scientific American, where they measured the efficiency of locomotion for all these species on planet earth. How many kilocalories did they expend to get from point A to point B? And the condor won, came in at the top of the list, surpassed everything else. And humans came in about a third of the way down the list, which was not such a great showing for the crown of creation. But somebody there had the imagination to test the efficiency of a human riding a bicycle. A human riding a bicycle blew away the condor all the way off the top of the list. And it made a really big impression on me that we humans are tool builders. And that we can fashion tools that amplify these inherent abilities that we have to spectacular magnitudes. And so for me, a computer has always been a bicycle of the mind. Something that takes us far beyond our inherent abilities. And I think we&#8217;re just at the early stages of this tool. Very early stages. And we&#8217;ve come only a very short distance. And it&#8217;s still in its formation, but already we&#8217;ve seen enormous changes. I think that&#8217;s nothing compared to what&#8217;s coming in the next hundred years.&#8221;</p>
