<p>&#8220;Simplicity can come before or after complexity. If it comes before, you&#8217;re stupid. If it comes after, you&#8217;re a genius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Altruism and selfishness are no longer mutually exclusive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When you come at the king, you best not miss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A sentence with &#8216;cookie&#8217;, especially plural, should never have the word &#8216;regret&#8217; in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody thinks it will work, do they?
No. You just described every great success story.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aut inveniam viam aut faciam.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d hold you up to say to your mother, &#8216;this kid&#8217;s gonna be the best kid in the world. This kid&#8217;s gonna be somebody better than anybody I ever knew.&#8217; And you grew up good and wonderful. It was great just watching you, every day was like a privilege. Then the time come for you to be your own man and take on the world, and you did. But somewhere along the line, you changed. You stopped being you. You let people stick a finger in your face and tell you you&#8217;re no good. And when things got hard, you started looking for something to blame, like a big shadow. Let me tell you something you already know. The world ain&#8217;t all sunshine and rainbows. It&#8217;s a very mean and nasty place and I don&#8217;t care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it. You, me, or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain&#8217;t about how hard ya hit. It&#8217;s about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. How much you can take and keep moving forward. That&#8217;s how winning is done! Now if you know what you&#8217;re worth then go out and get what you&#8217;re worth. But ya gotta be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain&#8217;t where you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain&#8217;t you! You&#8217;re better than that! I&#8217;m always gonna love you no matter what. No matter what happens. You&#8217;re my son and you&#8217;re my blood. You&#8217;re the best thing in my life. But until you start believing in yourself, ya ain&#8217;t gonna have a life. Don&#8217;t forget to visit your mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They&#8217;re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can&#8217;t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They push the human race forward. While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I&#8217;ve lost almost 300 games. 26 times I&#8217;ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I&#8217;ve failed over and over and over again in my life...and that is why I succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men (and women) wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages. Bitter cold. Long months of complete darkness. Constant danger. Safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you aren&#8217;t standing on the edge, you&#8217;re taking up too much space.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The squeakiest wheel gets the oil.
But the loudest bird gets shot first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The clearest sign that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you â€” ask what you can do for your country.</p>

<p>My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.</p>

<p>Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you. With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God&#8217;s work must truly be our own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at the world through gentler eyes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not everyone can become a great artist, but a great artist can come from anywhere.&#8221;</p>
