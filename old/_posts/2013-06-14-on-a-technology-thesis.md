Thought this would be an interesting exercise, but the email got so long over the last hour that I have to have, like, a table of contents. My fear is that such a long email will cockblock a fruitful discussion (man, I don't have time for this shit), but the hope is that this topic is interesting enough to overcome that.

Section 1: Introductions -- lots of names floating around on this email
Section 2: Thesis? Da fuq? -- what do you think the future looks like? what would be the biggest changes to human behavior as a result?

---------------------------

Section 1: Introductions
This is a topic that I thought would benefit from folks not yet on LAC discussing -- in particular, a few people Kane roped together for a Sunday afternoon meetup to talk tech. Didn't add all the new folks to LAC directly because growing lists inorganically feels like just that; inorganic. My general rule of thumb is that if most people have met in person, then it's all good. I think we're almost there.

New folks cc'd: James Knight (Romotive -> Google, engineer), Josh Vekhter (Mathematician -> ZocDoc, engineer), Kevin Kwok (Greylock, VC), and David Luan (Thiel fellow -> founder of computer vision startup) joined us for an afternoon talking shop. Peter Boyce needs no introduction.

Leather Apron Club (LAC): a wannabe intellectual descendant of Ben Franklin's Junto. You've got (from this past Sunday) me, Kane, Lisa, Yoni, Allen, and also Dennis Tang (GQ editor), Winston Yan (MD/Phd at Harvard), Tina Zou (Goldman banker, soon to be data scientist), Kevin Lee (Hudson River Trading, continuing to be Hudson River Trading), and Benny Zhu (Founder of financial data analytics company).

Phew. That was way longer than I intended, but for sake of positively growing a small group, hope it was worth it.

Section 2: Defining a thesis
Quick background: Michael got a meeting with Fred Wilson of Union Square Ventures, and I started wondering how one might impress a guy like Fred Wilson. One answer -- have a thesis on what will happen next in the world of technology -- led to a bigger question: what would our thesis be and, almost the more difficult question, how would we even find it?


For example, when FW started USV, his thesis was effectively two-fold: 1) web services, or the application layer, will inject technology into the lives of the masses and 2) NYC will be a mecca for start-up technology because media, telecom, and finance would be the next areas gobbled up by tech.

This thesis seems trivial now, but it wasn't in 2004. In fact, it flatly contradicted mainstream thinking and it's been the intellectual underpinning for USV's success (that and not being dicks).

So let's try to tackle the questions in reverse. First, how would we even find a thesis? I imagine it would be a triangulation between a) the past and b) imaginations of the future. The past informs us of general principles by which value is determined and created, and imaginations of the future helps us Wayne Gretsky.

To me, value falls into time, status, or pleasure (status being big and different enough in nature from pleasure that I break it out) and it is created by either human or technological means (I lump pack animals in with "technology"). Historically, mass wealth was created by enslaving (Ford and MSFT count), claiming, or trading and often a combination of the three. Today, we effectively do the same with technology: we buy technology, claim digital land and mind share, and trade the results.

Given all that, what could be massively valuable in the future? Put another way, what would our thesis be? A first order estimate might be [insert trend already happening in certain industries, e.g., web services] will come to dominate [insert industry not yet affected]. But let's bump up to second order. We're hearing a lot about 'the internet of things', 'wearable computing', '3Dification' (both UX and atoms <-> bits) and augmented reality, which are all really ways of breaking computing out of their traditional domains (i.e., computer devices) to help users fuse technology more naturally with the world around them. In other words, as technology advances, it becomes less apparent to the end user.

This is probably far enough for a VC's practical purposes. If your head's too far in the clouds, you'll pretty soon find it up your own ass.

For t3h shits, what if we think 3rd order: if software will eat the world, what will eat software? My sense is that new hardware paradigms will birth new ways of conceiving of and architecting software. If you've read Innovator's Dilemma (summary here), you might recognize this as a kind of meta disruption (not the buzzword disruption here, but as originally defined by Christensen). As software becomes more and more attractive from a business perspective (insane margins, massive scalability, insanely low capital outlay), folks trend towards it at the expense of lower-margin, smaller markets. But these are exactly the places where innovation happens and how large established companies get eaten up.

So, I'll rephrase this as short-, medium-, and long-term theses:

Short-term (next 5 years): Software will continue eating the world
Medium-term (next 10 years): Software will be abstracted away in much the same way hardware is being abstracted away today--all about the UX
Long-term (next ?? years?): Hardware will eat software (e.g., your brain is simultaneously hardware and software)

Before this afternoon, I'd never really thought about a "thesis" and certainly don't have any convictions on what will happen in the future of technology. I'm just spewing shit here, so very curious to hear what you all think about what lies ahead, especially if you have something more specific than these absurdly broad strokes.

On that note, a brain fart: we've been biased (so far, anyway) to the leading edge of technology.

​I sort of wrote off the expansion of current trends to wider industries / people as first order, but that's probably short-sighted of me.

​I would only need to point to emergent properties that might arise as more people and industries catch up to where leaders are today. One cell whatevs, but a few trillion?

​I like the wave metaphor--disruption happens both from fully processing a wave (long-form disruption?) and from new waves.
