### Color

#### Photon interactions
A photon can interact with a surface in a number of ways:

- [Absorption](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absorption_%28electromagnetic_radiation%29): the energy from the photon is transformed into the internal energy of the absorber (e.g., thermal energy).
- [Reflection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28physics%29): the energy from the photon changes direction back into the medium form which the photon originated.
- [Diffuse Reflection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection): an incident ray of light is reflected in many directions, not just one angle.
- [Specular Reflection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specular_reflection): an incident ray of light is reflected in one direction (e.g., in mirrors).
- [Transparency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparency_and_translucency): an incident ray of light travels through an interrupting medium unchanged
- [Refraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refraction): an incident ray of light travels through an interrupting medium, but alters direction
- [Fluorescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorescence): an incident ray is absorbed and emitted, often at a different wavelength
- [Subsurface scattering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering): an incident ray goes into a surface, bounces around one or more times, and comes back out at a different places than the point of entry
- [Phosphorescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence): an incident ray is aborbed and emitted at some later time
- [Interreflection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection#Interreflection): an incident ray strikes reflects some energy, which strikes and illuminates nearby surfaces
