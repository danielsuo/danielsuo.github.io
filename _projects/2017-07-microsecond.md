During my (brief) time with Berkeley's [DeepDrive](https://deepdrive.berkeley.edu/) project, we found that the cameras mounted to our test vehicle were out of sync; some would arrive a few frames ahead of others. Now, of course, there are many reasons this might be the case (buffering of any kind at any point), we wanted to eliminate any hardware concerns (e.g., the camera trigger mechanisms).

Hence a microsecond clock that you point all your cameras at.
