At one point in my life, I was very serious about classical music. After my parents convinced me that I might have more optionality doing other things with my life, I mostly stopped. I think these might be the last two recordings I have of myself. They're painful to listen to; they reek of immaturity. But my 16-year old self is likely more technically capable than I'll ever have time to be again.

If that ever changes, I'll update this page. First, we must acquire a home that can properly house my [dream piano](https://shigerukawai.com/pianos/sk-ex.html). Then, we must get a second mortgage to acquire said piano. And maybe a third so I have time to practice.


So with all those caveats logged (yes, I'm embarrassed in case it wasn't obvious), here we are:

## Ballade No. 4, Op 52 - Frédéric Chopin

## Gaspard de la nuit "Ondine" - Maurice Ravel
