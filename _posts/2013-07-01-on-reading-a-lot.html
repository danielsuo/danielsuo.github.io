He has some good ideas, but it's missing a lot on the strategy of reading books quickly and understanding books holistically (way more important, I think).

Both are accomplished, I think, by understanding the structure of a book fairly well. This takes 15 minutes of upfront time that includes such simple things as reading the TOC, reading the forward to understand motivation, browsing the first few paragraphs of each chapter to relate back to the TOC / forward.

This by itself has sped up my reading the most because it provides context and meaning to the individual examples / paragraphs I'm reading. Sort of like how it's easier to clean if you already have a place for everything (which, I do not...).

Also...helps to know when to quit reading a book.
