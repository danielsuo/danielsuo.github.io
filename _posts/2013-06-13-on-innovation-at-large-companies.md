Yeah--when I was at McKinsey, I spent a lot of time reading about innovation in context of large business and there are just an overwhelming number of reasons why they cannot (and in this case should not) be true innovators.

 However, I still disagree with this guy's advice because I see it as short-sighted. First, companies who adopt this attitude of buying innovation almost never stay at the forefront of observing said innovation (i.e., even if they could buy it, they don't see it). Second, companies with vast resources are exactly the ones who could be bearing the risk of trying (and failing), but instead, institutional pressure prevents them from even trying. If you try to innovate and fail, your job is on the line, but as the old saying goes, "no one ever got fired for buying IBM" (i.e., taking the conservative path).

I admire companies like Google and Intel because they don't mind investing large amounts of capital on unknown payoffs from R&D. However, even they fall into a particular type of innovation trap articulated by Professor Christensen at HBS (innovator's dilemma) -- as companies mature, they tend towards greener pastures (e.g., higher-margin higher-end products), but in doing so, they leave themselves vulnerable to scrappy upstarts who don't mind the brown grass and eventually eat the big companies from behind.

This is probably too much information without enough context, so I'll stop here. Simply put: large companies don't "innovate" as much as they should, but for very understandable, if not excusable, reasons.


Also, it goes without saying that his logic reduces to no innovation. Why should _anyone_ bother innovating? Especially if my entire life's savings and years of my efforts as an entrepreneur are going into something that might fail.

One last thought: Lisa is working on an internal project for McKinsey reviewing survey information from CEOs and other business leaders regarding long-term planning. One of the main criticisms and complaints of and from business people today is that short-term thinking persists. For example, we'll do everything we can to make this quarter's sales look good, even to the detriment of future quarters and we certainly wouldn't invest large amounts today because a) that's money out today and b) uncertain gains tomorrow.

McKinsey's chief has been pushing this concept 'Long-Term Capitalism' for the past year or two, but I think his message is both flawed and naive. He raises the well-known problems I described above, but offers solutions that are fairly trivial (mostly of the flavor, X group of influential people must champion and lead the charge). These solutions simply don't address the pressures that these people face. As a board member of a public company, I am paid several hundred K a year to go to a few board meetings and if I rock the boat, share prices might go down. If they go down, not only would I lose my seat, I'd also likely lose status and future board positions as well. As an institutional investor (think Vanguard), if I can't generate good returns each quarter, people will move money from my fund to someone else's--and I will get paid significantly less!

The one example of a great company that is both innovating and investing for the long term is Amazon. I completely forgot about them earlier, but a conversation with Lisa just now reminded me. For virtually their entire existence, they've told their shareholders that they will reinvest all profit back into the business (i.e., no profit left to distribute to shareholders). The only reason they can get away with this and still have such a well-performing valuation (as indicated by stock price) is because they have proven time and again that they make very, very good use of that capital. They are "taking over the world" and generating better returns on that capital than the vast majority of investors could do otherwise, so they don't complain!

In a word, they have earned shareholder trust to invest for the long-term. This is the key component missing in all of these initiatives and speeches and everything else. I trust that you will spend my money better than I could spend it myself. And just like any other form of trust, it must be earned and it will never be easy!
