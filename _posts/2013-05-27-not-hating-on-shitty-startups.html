title: Don't hate (on the shitty start-ups)
---

As much as I hate on ridiculous start-ups (the saving grace for mine is we're tackling challenging computer vision problems...or something), I'm beginning to change my tune.

"Start-ups" as we'd typically conceive of the genre are really just small businesses that are looking to very rapidly become massive businesses by means of technology. The disillusion (and, consequently, my hate) is twofold: 1) it's not OK to be a small company and 2) technology will enable away bad business.

But now, I'm thinking that maybe it's not so bad to have such hype. For one, the allure of Billions is spurring people to be creative, if a bit silly. That's ok! It wasn't obvious that planes shouldn't have flapping wings, but hey, had to fail a zillion ways first before we discovered lift.

Two, the hype is pushing more and more people to learn computer science. Not knowing how to program is like being illiterate. Not knowing algorithms and data structures is like not having read the classics.

And last (yes, McKinsey 3): technology is a great equalizer. Before, you just threw cheap labor at the problem, controlled the means of production and voila! You're making cash money at the expense of the broletariat.

This was longer than I intended it to be, but I've been contemplating my dying hate (and growing amusement) and this is the first time I'm articulating. I do believe that there are pressing world problems to address and that technology will help us solve many of them, but it will take time. Is it annoying that every MBA who can find a code monkey is trying to start a fashion start-up? Sure, but we're only 20 years in with the internet and Lord knows we're having growing pains.
