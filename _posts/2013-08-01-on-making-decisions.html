title: On making decisions
---

TTHAT'S AWESOME! Excitement aside, I see strong forward-looking arguments for both sides, so I'll just offer how I think about such things without much in the way of advice. That and I've never really articulated how I make decisions, so I was curious. Looks a bit long, but the whole process usually takes less than a minute:

First, I almost never make decisions with too much consideration for the long-term beyond protecting against obvious downsides (e.g., drug addiction, murder, public burning of important bridges). The thing I know for sure is I don't know how life will turn out and more importantly, how I'll feel about it. The assumption is that ambition and openness to unexpected twists will get me to the right place. Right place, of course, being unknown today.

Second, I see opportunities as different (unknown) distributions of outcomes rather than two (or more) singular outcomes to choose between. I'm just looking for general knowns while recognizing my own actions/reactions affect the distributions a lot. In this particular case, I might see rapgenius as investing more in social capital (access to top entrepreneurs and VCs) with opportunity to recruit / lead top technical folks (not as in the weeds, but definitely seeing broad strokes) and I might see not rapgenius as investing more in intellectual capital. Both, like financial capital, benefit from earlier investment.

Third, if I'm debating between two or more options, that means they're either all good or all shitty. That eliminates a lot of angst. In your case, they're all good (er, that is, when the rest materialize. You could delay Rap Genius by saying you want to complete other processes to have full set of information).

Fourth, when finally pulling the trigger, I answer the question 'what's the worse that could happen' because, as per above, I'm interested in bounding downside risk.

I'm now realizing this has perhaps uncomfortable implications for Lisa, but she probably could've guessed...
