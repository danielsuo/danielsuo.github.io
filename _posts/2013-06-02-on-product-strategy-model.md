Great article. Sounds like some of the better stuff from amongst the business garbage I read.

Using his paradigm, I'd say, we're still in the product phase and just beginning to articulate strategy (e.g., making data collection free so that people have what they need to use our great tools). I don't think it's bad to keep potential business models in mind (as we're doing), as long as we're not beholden to any one in particular.

One slight criticism of the note: FW doesn't define strategy and assumes folks just know what the word means. I would argue that most people do not, in fact, know what it means and even if "they do", it means different things to different people. For example, one could argue that strategy is really a spectrum across different time horizons. Strategy for getting the next sale would be on the short end and might be called a tactic. Strategy for bringing product to market might be a "strategy". And strategy for the next ten years might be called vision.

So let's define strategy, for the moment, as getting from A to B over some time horizon (say, the next year). Then what FW is really saying is that before we lock down a business model, we must determine B and our path to B, and that _good_ strategy finds some B where we add tremendous value / is very difficult for others to reach. When and only when we deliver massive, defensible value (i.e., the result of smart strategy), can we begin to truly think about monetizing the value created (i.e., the business model).

Put very simply: first figure out if people want it, then make them need it, then charge for it in the most natural and (hopefully) profitable way.
