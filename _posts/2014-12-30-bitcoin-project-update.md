At the expense of this front page, I have been logging updates over the last month on a separate [project](projects/bitcoin) page. I don't yet have a good system for documenting project increments, so this will have to do for now.

Briefly, there are now two software packages and a growing library of literature / my notes. I will post more in-depth updates if there is anything substantive to say.
