Sad to see free-for-all APIs go

2 takeaways for me:

1) Take the Google approach to APIs: i.e., the high road (Reader notwithstanding). I gorged on the Maps API yesterday and it is excellent. Their philosophy is use our API by all means (even commercially), but we don't want you abusing, so we'll rate-limit unless you pay some nominal fee to help us cover costs.

From a business perspective, I do believe that it's more powerful to have the extremely free API for an extremely valuable service because it is the single best way to develop an incredible (and incredibly defensible) ecosystem. Certainly the extremely valuable is the necessary and more important short-term component (Facebook / Twitter doing well, but Podio, with it's really great API, is meh), but I'll hypothesize that you eventually stagnate unless you promote a vibrant, self-sustaining ecosystem for developers (not just users).

2) Really, truly question direct competition (e.g., Google+ vs Facebook). Usually, it's not a good idea. If we do compete directly, have a very clear idea how we win. Last year, I read a really compelling (and contrarian) article for Google+'s long game and its brilliance, but I can't find it and don't remember what it was (not Brad Feld's article; that's fluff).
