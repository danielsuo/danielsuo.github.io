title: On a crowdsourcing model
---

Anyway, a completely unsolicited thought for consumer crowdsourcing (sounds like you're thinking about enterprise): there's an intriguing co-op grocery store in Park Slope, Brooklyn (a land of yuppies / hipsters...yupsters?). They have very cheap, extremely high quality food because in order to shop there, you must work for X hours / month in the store. They have massive throughput because competitors can't come close on value (ignoring, for the moment, other unfair advantages e.g., the community feel, possibly less profit-motivated owners).

To link back to crowdsourcing, you effectively make demand for and supply of labor the same. This likely doesn't work for many problems (i.e., is Park Slope replicable), but may have applications that an otherwise strictly better duolingo / recaptcha model (supply and demand demand and supply each other) can't address. Perhaps processing high-demand data: to consume processed data (e.g., deduplicated tweets), you must process some data or pay some money. Mathematically, I think this scales; each piece of data needs to get processed a few times to ensure accuracy, but can be consumed by a massive number of people.
